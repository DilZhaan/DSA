# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my implementations and practice exercises related to Data Structures and Algorithms. I have been learning from the Hex Coder Youtube Channel, and I've uploaded my code here for reference and sharing with the community.

## Custom Linked List

In this section, you'll find the implementation of a custom linked list. The linked list provides basic functionality such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Usage

You can use the linked list by including the `linkedList_nxt.cpp` file in your project. While the current implementation lacks comments, it is highly recommended to add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each section of the code.

## Queue Implementations

### Linked List Queue (C++)

In this section, you'll find the implementation of a queue using a linked list. The `queueLinkList.cpp` file contains the code for basic queue operations using a linked list.

#### Usage

Include the `queueLinkList.cpp` file in your C++ project. While the current implementation lacks comments, it is highly recommended to add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each section of the code.

### Array Queue (C++)

The `queueArray.cpp` file contains the implementation of a queue using a static array. It provides enqueue and dequeue operations.

#### Usage

Include the `queueArray.cpp` file in your C++ project. Similar to the linked list queue, please consider adding comments to enhance code readability and understanding.

### Stack Queue (C++)

This section includes a queue implemented using a stack. The `queue_stack.cpp` file demonstrates how to create a queue using two stacks.

#### Usage

Include the `queue_stack.cpp` file in your C++ project. While the code may currently lack comments, it is strongly advised to add comments for better code comprehension.

## Stack Implementations

### Linked List Stack (C++)

Here, you'll find the implementation of a stack using a linked list in the `stackLinkList.cpp` file.

#### Usage

Include the `stackLinkList.cpp` file in your C++ project. While the current code may not have comments, please consider adding comments to elucidate the purpose of each code segment.

### Dynamic Array Stack (C++)

The `stackDArray.cpp` file contains the implementation of a stack using a dynamic array. It includes push, pop, and peek operations.

#### Usage

Include the `stackDArray.cpp` file in your C++ project. Similar to the other implementations, adding comments will significantly improve the code's understandability.

### Array Stack (C++)

This section presents a stack implementation using a static array in the `stackArray.cpp` file.

#### Usage

Include the `stackArray.cpp` file in your C++ project. While the code currently lacks comments, adding comments will make the code more accessible to others.

## Recursion

### Factorial Program (Python)

The `factorial.py` file includes a solution for calculating factorial using recursion in Python.

### Fibonacci Program using Recursion

I've included a program that calculates Fibonacci numbers using recursion.

### Usage

Feel free to use the `fibonacci.cpp` file in your projects. While the current implementation lacks comments, it is highly recommended to add comments to explain the logic and purpose of each section of the code.


### Usage

You can use the `factorial.py` file for factorial calculations in Python projects. While the code may be clear, adding comments will provide further clarity on the recursive factorial algorithm.
